# Cprog
Hello
Cprog is a really simple android app that musicians can use to store the chords of any songs in the shorthand way.

The app begins with a simple layout having two buttons-
      1. ADD: To add new songs to ur list.
      2. VIEW: To display all the songs u have regitered till yet.
               Long press on a particular item allows you to either
               delete that particular song or make some changes to it.
